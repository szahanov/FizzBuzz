Predicting image types using three different classification/regression algorithms.

This work is inspired by the idea of a FizzBuzz program used to find developers to hire - https://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/ - I was wondering what the data science equivalent would be and did this.

Data is taken from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Image+Segmentation
That has data for images that fall into 7 categories: brickface, sky, foliage, cement, window, path, and grass

I take the data and use the Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbour, and Support Vector algorithms to find out which class each image belongs to.
